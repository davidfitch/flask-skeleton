Basic flask skeleton using blueprints and app factory. 

config.py supports dev, test, and prod environment configs

manage.py supports "runserver" and "shell" commands

install dependencies with "pip install -r requirements.txt"

virtual environment included, but you should delete "venv" and recreate with your own local python libs

main app is, not surpsingly, contained in "app"

the skeleton contains two blueprints, primarily to demonstrate use of multiple blueprints in an example app

templates for each blueprint are grouped under the template dir, with subdir corresponding to blueprint name
